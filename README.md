# CompressiveSensing
This repository contains materials for the course "Compressive Sensing" given in Summer Semesters at FAU by Dr.-Ing. Ali Bereyhi. The lecture is mainly consistent with the textbook "A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing" by Foucart and Rauhut. Nevertheless, in some parts, the contents are out of the textbook.
## Lecture-notes
The handouts of the lecture-slides are uploaded by Chapter. There are in total 7 chapters. The chapter numbers are however NOT consistent with the textbook and is based on the lecture contents itself. Some chapters of the lecture-notes contain multiple chapters of the textbook.
## Notebooks
There is a directory with few notebooks which contain numerical experiments. These notebooks are tried to be self-contained. You could download them, play around with them, run the codes and even add to them. The purpose is to make you familiar with some basic coding tasks in Python which along with the lecture can train you to use your knowledge in practice.
