# CompressiveSensing
This repository contains materials for the course "Compressive Sensing" given in Summer Semesters at FAU by Dr.-Ing. Ali Bereyhi. The lectFoucart ure is mainly consistent with the textbook "A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing" by Foucart and Rauhut. Nevertheless, in some parts, contents out of the textbook are also included.
## Lecture-notes
The handouts of the lecture-slides are uploaded by Chapter. The chapter however is NOT consistent with the textbook and is based on the lecture cntents itself.
## Notebooks
There is a directory with few notebooks which contain numerical experiments. These notebooks are tried to be self-contained. You could download them, play around with them, run the codes and even add to them. The purpose is to make you familiar with some basic coding tasks in Python which along with the lectures can train you to use your knowledge in practice.
